Welcome! This is a reprository for hobby projects to practice my coding. For collabs or questions feel free to contact me.

## Games

### • Tic-tac-toe &nbsp; &nbsp; ➼ my first game in C.

Available in Dutch and English. When starting the game choose a language.

## Tools

### • Dectohex-converter &nbsp; &nbsp; ➼ tool to convert decimals to hexadecimals.

Output is currently showing all hexadecimal numbers between: 0 // 0x0 => .. <= 4096 // 0x1000.  
Code can output up to unsigned long long max: 1,844,674,407,370,955,1615 // 0xffffffffffffffff.

Output is given in the following format: "[DEC] - [HEX]".
