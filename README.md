# Hobby Projects 🚀

Welcome to my hobby projects repository! This collection showcases various coding projects I've built for learning and experimentation. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or reach out with questions.

## 🎮 Games

### Tic-tac-toe
My first game implementation in C, featuring:
- Multi-language support (Dutch and English)
- Language selection at game start
- Command-line interface

## 🛠️ Tools

### Decimal to Hexadecimal Converter
A utility for converting decimal numbers to hexadecimal format:
- Current output range: 0 (0x0) to 4096 (0x1000)
- Capable of handling numbers up to unsigned long long max: 1,844,674,407,370,955,1615 (0xffffffffffffffff)
- Output format: "[DEC] - [HEX]"

## 🔬 Simulations

### Hundred Prisoners Problem
A simulation comparing two strategies for the famous 100 prisoners problem:
- Loop strategy vs. Random guessing
- Based on the scenario from [Veritasium's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA)
- Statistical analysis of success rates
